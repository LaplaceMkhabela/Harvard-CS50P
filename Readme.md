## Comments
Relearning conditionals has been an unexpectedly fun and rewarding experience!. 
Even though I'm comfortable with Python, going back to if-elif-else logic, 
boolean expressions, and pattern matching with match has been surprisingly enjoyable.

Working through loops again has been a valuable refresher on writing efficient and 
maintainable iteration logic. 
I love how python approaches **for loops it very different to how I'm used to doing it in C++.

## Comments

This has been by far the most challenging section of the course
Learning defensive programming and handling errors that may occur in user input has fun.

### Positives
A win for me this week was being able to gain deep insight into 
the different types exceptions,how to use *raise* and the *try* *except* statements. 

### Negatives
So far I have no issues with the course,I just need more time to
grasp how variable scope works in python.

## Comments

This has been by far the most intresting and fun section of the course for me,I learned alot about modules in python.


### Positives
A win for me this week was being able to solve all the problems in the set alot quicker than the previous week and also 
the problems were alot more intresting this week, I had fun ðŸ™‚

### Negatives
The documentation for the inflect module was very not descriptive that slowed me down a bit.
The two failed test set me several hours in debugging,the logic in those tests does not seem consistent with the 
problems in my oppinion.
